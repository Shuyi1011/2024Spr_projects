## Data Resource
### Data folder on Github
It's NOT the data that I'm using to analyze. It's used ONLY for doctest!!!

### Data from 1820-2023
This is the official website that provides greencard data from 1820-2023: https://www.dhs.gov/ohss/topics/immigration/yearbook/2022#test

I upload this to google drive link1: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SIk0FxaTAh3KJXnbInocN_SXfpdcxFPs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108691628548360077963&rtpof=true&sd=true

### PERM Data
This is the official website that provides original PERM data: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance

I export them as csv documents, which can be read faster in python. I upload them into google drive link2: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17CmdnmZGGA9ioVx_8x7-Wx-iq7bTN0Jg?usp=sharing

I combine all PERM data into one csv file, and only keep the necessary columns. Here is the link3: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2ajnRIXJGRfK8GvMB6tHfV6rgKgqPFR/view?usp=sharing 

### How to use the code
The data files are huge, I cannot push them to github. Sorry for the inconvience.
You can skip the PERM data process, use the third google drive link to download the csv file which contains all PERM data with necessary columns. Remember to change the path name before you run the code.

## Reports
(still working on it ^_^)
I'm writing a report about data analysis results: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blIcICMFL6RSPkP97CdUQTYpVWVAXpJMSojWlr5yms8/edit?usp=sharing
