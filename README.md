## Data Resource
### PERM Data
This is the official website that provides original PERM data: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance

I export them as csv documents, which can be read faster in python. I upload them into google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17CmdnmZGGA9ioVx_8x7-Wx-iq7bTN0Jg?usp=sharing

## Reports
I'm writing a report about data analysis results: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blIcICMFL6RSPkP97CdUQTYpVWVAXpJMSojWlr5yms8/edit?usp=sharing
